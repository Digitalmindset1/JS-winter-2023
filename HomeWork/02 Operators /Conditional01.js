// Conditional (Ternary) Operator
// 1. Write a program that declares a variable age and assigns it a number value representing a person's age. Then, use the conditional operator to determine if the person is old enough to vote. If the person is old enough, print the string "You are old enough to vote" to the console. Otherwise, print the string "You are not old enough to vote" to the console.

let age = 2;
let message = (age >=18) ? 'You are old enought to vote' : 'You are not old enough to vote';
console.log(message);
