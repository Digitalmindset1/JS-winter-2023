// Conditional (Ternary) Operator
// 2. Write a program that declares a variable price and assigns it a number value representing the price of a product. Then, use the conditional operator to determine if the product is on sale. If the product is on sale, print the string "The product is on sale" to the console. Otherwise, print the string "The product is not on sale" to the console.

let price = 14;

let message = (price > 100) ? 'The product is on sale' : ' The product is not on sale';
console.log(message);
