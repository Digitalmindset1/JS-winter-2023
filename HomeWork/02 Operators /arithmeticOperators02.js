// Arithmetic Operators. Multiplications
// 01 Write a program that declares a variable radius and assigns it a number value representing the radius of a circle. Then, use the exponentiation operator to calculate the area of the circle (pi times radius squared). Print the resulting area to the console.

let r = -1;
let pi = 3.14;

let area = r > 0 ? pi * r * r : 'Please enter the correct radius of a circle';
console.log(area)
