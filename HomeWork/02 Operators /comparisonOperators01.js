// Comparison Operators
// 1. Write a program that declares two variables age1 and age2, assigns them number values representing the ages of two different people, and then uses the greater than operator to determine if age1 is greater than age2. Print the resulting boolean value to the console.


let age1 = 22;
let age2 = 30;
let isAge1Greater = age1 > age2;
console.log('Is age1 greater than age2?' + isAge1Greater);
