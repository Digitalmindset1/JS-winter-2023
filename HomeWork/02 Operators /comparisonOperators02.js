// Comparison Operators
// 2. Write a program that declares a variable name and assigns it a string value representing a person's name. Then, use the not equal to operator to determine if name is not equal to the string "John Doe". Print the resulting boolean value to the console.

let fullName = "Niiaz Murtazin";
let isName = fullName !== "John Doe";
console.log("Is name not equal to 'John Doe'? " + isName);
