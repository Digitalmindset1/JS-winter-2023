// Logical Operators:
// Write a program that declares two variables isMember and hasCoupon, assigns them boolean values indicating whether or not a customer is a member and whether or not they have a coupon code, and then uses the logical OR operator to determine if the customer is eligible for free shipping. Print the resulting boolean value to the console.

let isMember = false;
let hasCoupon = false;

let isEligibleForFreeShipping = isMember || hasCoupon;
console.log('Is the customer eligible for free shipping?' + isEligibleForFreeShipping);
